# Master-Tech

I made this business website to showcase my front-end and programming skills. It describes the nature of the business, all of its regular activities, and how it markets itself via this website. This project made use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
Customers who would like to get in touch for a project can quickly find the company's contact information on the website, connect with them, and start working on a project together.
